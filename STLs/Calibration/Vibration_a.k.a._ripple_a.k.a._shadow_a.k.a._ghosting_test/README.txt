# Summary

1. Print  
2. Inspect for ghosting of the sharp edges (letters, dimples, corners)  
3. Proof your machine for vibration  
4. ???  
5. Profit!

Note: I've noticed a lot of people complaining it's rotated wrong by default. It's actually not rotated wrong, it's just not rotated very intuitively :)

The letter X is not supposed to be parallel with the X axis - it's supposed to indicate vibration of the X axis. Since vibration of the X axis is perpendicular to the Y axis, the face that says "X" needs to be parallel with the Y axis.

# Instructions

Make sure to test with both PLA and ABS at a variety of temperatures.  

The hotter the extrusion, the more liquid it is and more obvious the vibration artifacts will be. Also, PLA is much less viscous than ABS.  

Test with a variety of colors as well. Semi-transparent filaments tend to hide the vibration artifacts rather well. As do matte and very light filaments. Glossy black and opaque silver work very very well.  

Mind the X and Y orientation when slicing - having the labels correspond to actual X and Y axes will make debugging easier.
