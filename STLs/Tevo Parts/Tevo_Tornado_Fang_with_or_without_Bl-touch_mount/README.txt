# Summary

Fang Replacement Fan shroud for stock Tevo Tornado hot end.

+ The shroud has two mounting points, one of them is an original mounting point and the other one attaches to one of the threaded holes in the stock heat sink. 

+ I've uploaded two versions, one that supports the bl-touch mount and one that does not. 

+ It uses two 40mm radial fans that can be installed with 4 M3x12 screws each or other self-tapping screws that fit the mounting holes.

+ For the bl-touch version, you will and additional M3x8 screw for the mounting point where the bl-touch and the fan shroud overlap. 

+ I printed at 0.3mm layer with 15% infill and rectilinear supports with overhang threshold of 30 degrees.
