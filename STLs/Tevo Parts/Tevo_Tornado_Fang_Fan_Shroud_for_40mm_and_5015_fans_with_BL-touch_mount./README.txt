Tevo Tornado Fang Fan Shroud for 40mm and 5015 fans with BL-touch mount. by gdramos is licensed under the Creative Commons - Attribution license.

# Summary

Fang Replacement Fan shroud for stock Tevo Tornado hot end. It's an evolution of the first Fang shroud I made that uses two 40mm fans. You can check that one out here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2756527

Printing:
 + I printed mine at 0.3mm layer height with 15% infill at 60mm/s. The shroud was printed with supports disabled and the rest of the pieces with supports(one of the brackets needs supports for a couple of inset screw holes).
 + I printed in eSUN PLA+, but regular PLA should do the job just fine as well. 

Assembling:
 + Be careful when sliding the blower brackets into place as applying excessive force may cause them to break. Learned that the hard way. 
 + Once the 5015 fan is installed, the brackets feel pretty sturdy thanks to the rigidity provided by the body of the fan. 
 + You can superglue the 5015 fan brackets if you want, but It's not necessary. I didn't glue mine and it holds up just fine. 
 + As far as fasteners go, I used machine screws and just pre-tap the holes with one of the screws before mounting the fans.

Hardware: 
 + Original shroud screws(x2)
 + x4 M3x12 screws or other self-tapping screws that fit the mounting holes for the 40mm fan.
 + x2 M3x20 screw to mount the 5015 blower fan. 
 + x1 M3x8 screw for mounting hole where BL-touch mount overlaps Fang mounting leg.

Fans:
 + I'd previously converted all my fans to 12V fans using a step-down regulator to power them.
 + x1 40mm fan for hotend ( stock one may be used, but I went with a Noctua NF-A4x10 FLX)
 + x1 5015 blower fan (I got mine from Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071WMHNG5/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Testing:
 + I printed the 150mm bridging test found here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2754688
 + It did well in my opinion. Not perfect, but you can judge from the picture.

The Bad:
 + If you have the frame brace mod on your Tornado, you will loose some height because of the blower fan sticking up.
